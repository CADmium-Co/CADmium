/**
 * `<TrackballControls>` allow the camera to orbit freely around a target
 * without causing gimbal lock. This type of camera controller is commonly used
 * when the concepts of up and down are less important than the ability to
 * carefully inspect a model from every angle.
 *
 * For an alternative camera controller, see
 * [`<OrbitControls>`](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/extras/orbit-controls).
 *
 * The component `<TrackballControls>` must be a direct child of a camera
 * component and will mount itself to that camera. By default, damping is
 * enabled. You can disable this by setting `staticMoving` to true.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```svelte
 * <script>
 *   import { TrackballControls } from '@threlte/extras'
 *   import { T } from '@threlte/core'
 * </script>
 *
 * <T.PerspectiveCamera
 *   makeDefault
 *   fov={50}
 * >
 *   <TrackballControls />
 * </T.PerspectiveCamera>
 * ```
 *
 * `<TrackballControls>` is a light wrapper that will use its parent as the target camera and the DOM element
 * the renderer is rendering to as the DOM element to listen to. It will also by demand invalidate the frame loop.
